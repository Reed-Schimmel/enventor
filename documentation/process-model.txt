      The software process model that would be appropriate for this project is the Waterfall Model. The reason for this is that this project is very requirement-based, therefore a more linear approach to software development would be more appropriate. Also, since the project is deadline-focused, a Waterfall approach would force structured organization that would force the completion of every phase before proceeding to another.

	In our project, we tried to adhere to the Waterfall Model as much as possible: we gathered the requirements for the project before we collectively came up with a design for the project, and then we moved forward with the implementation phase. However, it was more challenging to comply with the Waterfall Model in the implementation phase because it was difficult to complete the entire phase with a team. It was not entirely possible for each member of the team to complete the specific code implementation before testing the code. Therefore, after the design phase, we may have followed the Agile Method for our software development. After the testing process, the software was deployed and maintained as per the Waterfall Model requirement.

	Overall, we used the Waterfall Model as our main software process model. However, given the circumstances, it was realistically challenging to implement the model throughout the entire process, so we had to switch to the Agile Model in the middle of the project.
